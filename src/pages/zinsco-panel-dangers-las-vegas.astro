              Along with Federal Pacific, <strong>Zinsco</strong> is another brand
              of electrical panel that has been identified by experts as a significant
              safety hazard. These panels, also sold under the name <strong
                >GTE-Sylvania</strong
              >, were popular for several decades but were eventually
              discontinued due to major design flaws. If your home has a Zinsco
              panel, it is not a matter of <em>if</em> it will fail, but <em
                >when</em

                  Breakers Melt to the Bus Bar

                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                  The most critical flaw is that Zinsco breakers can appear to
                  be off or tripped, but are actually still allowing power to
                  flow. They often melt to the main aluminum bus bar, preventing
                  them from tripping during an overload. This creates a
                  continuous fire hazard that goes completely undetected.

                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                  Zinsco panels often used aluminum components which are prone
                  to corrosion and overheating, especially when connected to
                  copper wiring. This oxidation leads to poor connections,
                  arcing, and is a significant fire risk.
