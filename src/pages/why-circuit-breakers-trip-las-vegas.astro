            Why Do My Circuit Breakers Keep Tripping?

            A tripping breaker is a safety feature doing its job. But if it
            happens constantly, it's a sign of a deeper problem. Let's diagnose
            the common causes.

              It's a familiar frustration: you're running the microwave and the
              air conditioner, and suddenly, the power cuts out in half the
              house. A constantly tripping circuit breaker is more than an
              annoyance; it's your home's electrical system telling you that
              something is wrong. There are three primary reasons this happens.

                Cause #1: An Overloaded Circuit
              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 text-lg">
                This is the most common reason for a tripped breaker. A circuit
                is designed to handle a specific amount of electricity
                (amperage). When you plug in and run too many high-power devices
                on a single circuit, you exceed that limit, and the breaker
                trips to prevent the wires from overheating.

                <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-800">What to do:</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                  Try unplugging some devices from the circuit and moving them
                  to outlets in a different room. If you consistently overload
                  circuits in your kitchen or with a space heater, you may need
                  a dedicated circuit installed by an electrician.

            <!-- Cause 2: Short Circuit -->

                Cause #2: A Short Circuit
              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 text-lg">
                A short circuit is more serious. It occurs when a "hot" wire
                touches a "neutral" wire, often due to faulty wiring in an
                appliance or within your walls. This creates a surge of current
                that causes the breaker to trip instantly and forcefully.
              </p>
              <div class="mt-6 solution-box p-6 rounded-md">
                <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-800">What to do:</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                  If a breaker trips immediately after you plug in a specific
                  appliance, that appliance is likely the problem. However, if
                  the cause isn't obvious, you have a wiring issue that requires
                  a professional electrician to locate and repair safely.

            <!-- Cause 3: A Failing Panel or Breaker -->

              </h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 text-lg">
                Sometimes, the problem isn't what's plugged inâ€”it's the panel
                itself. Circuit breakers can wear out over time and trip without
                being overloaded. More seriously, an old or undersized
                electrical panel may not have the capacity for your home's total
                power needs, leading to frequent trips even with normal usage.

                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                  If you've ruled out overloads and short circuits, it's a
                  strong indication that your panel needs professional
                  attention. This is one of the clearest <a
